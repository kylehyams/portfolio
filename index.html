			<p class="featured__intro">My friendship with Matt Manzari dates back just shy of a decade. Since then it's hard to say that I've met someone as kind, generous and inspiring as him. So when I heard about his accident and how severe the damages, I wanted to help out any way possible. I decided that a shirt would be a great medium to raise awareness.</p>
