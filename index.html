			<p class="featured__intro">My friendship with Matt Manzari dates back just shy of a decade. Since then it's hard to say that I've met someone as kind, generous and inspiring as him. So when I heard about his accident and how severe the damages, I wanted to help out any way possible. I decided that a shirt would be a great medium to raise awareness.</p>

		<h3>The Shirt</h3>
	</aside>
	<article>
		<p>Using a wolf as the subject was an obvious decision. It's a symbol of Matt's fearlessness, strength and determination to rise above all obstacles. Incorporating Matt's Instagram username also gives meaning behind the graphic and makes this shirt his own. <a href="http://realthread.com" target="_blank">Real Thread</a> printed the design on American Apparel Poly-Cotton shirts using water based ink.</p>

		<h3>The Website</h3>
	</aside>
	<article>
		<p>While the shirts were in production, I designed and developed a responsive splash page. The goal of the site was to raise awareness of Matt's accident and to promote my outlet of support. I also included a one-step subscription form to generate leads and update those interested of availability.</p>

		<h3>Social Media</h3>
	</aside>
	<article>
		<p>Social media played a major role in promoting Matt’s shirt. Alliance Wakeboard Magazine, The Wakeskate Tour, Wakeboarding Magazine and others supported via Facebook and Instagram. Circulation was crucial to the shirt's success. As a result, their reach expanded across the globe and into the homes of supporters as far as Australia.</p>

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<p class="conclusion__copy">Meaningful design leveraged through social media resulted in the distribution of a respectable amount of shirts. All proceeds went to the Manzari family to help with Matt’s expenses. It's a true testament that the best projects are the ones that help your friends.</p>
		<p class="conclusion__copy">But Matt's not yet out of the woods. If you would like to help the Manzari family then please make a donation.</p>
