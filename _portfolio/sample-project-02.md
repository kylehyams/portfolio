I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. They will try to close the door on you, just open it. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.

Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.

The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. They don’t want us to win. They don’t want us to win. How’s business? Boomin. Fan luv. Fan luv.
