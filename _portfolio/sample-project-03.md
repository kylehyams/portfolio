How’s business? Boomin. Congratulations, you played yourself. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion! Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. How’s business? Boomin.

Lion! Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Stay focused. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Cloth talk. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.
